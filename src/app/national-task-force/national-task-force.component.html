    <p class="w-75" style="font-size: 125%;">
      There are over 73 Million People that have been identified as Directly Impacted by Disenfranchisement. When you
      include Extended Family, friends and Concerned Citizens, the Numbers Swell to Well Over 140,000,000 American
      Citizens.

      Collectively, this population has become a virtual Untapped Market of Consumers with the Economic Spending Power
      Greater than the Entire Economy of France!

      In Response, the National Task Force (NTF) was formed, in part, to Educate, Support, and Inspire the
      Disenfranchised to Look Inward for Solutions to Injustice and Inequality at Every Level.

      Under this Blueprint, the Disenfranchised can become a Dominant Social/Economic Force!</p>
